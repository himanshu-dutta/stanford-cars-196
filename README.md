# Stanford Cars Dataset With ResNet50 Architecture

This repository contains the notebook of the work on Stanford Cars 196 dataset, with the pretrained ResNet-50 model, achieving a performance of about 86%, with different data augmentation techniques, along with adaptive learning rate techniques, specifically, OneCycleLR policy, and parameter optimization techniques, like Gradient Clipping.


The performance can be further improved with more robust training, and increasing the number of epochs, but under current settings, the trained model can be comparable to the SoTA performance of ResNet-101 model over the data, which has an accuracy of about 92%.
